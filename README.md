# Spotcast 
Home Assistant custom component to start Spotify playback on an idle chromecast device

This component is not meant to be a full Spotify chromecast media_player but only serves to start the playback. Controlling the chromcast device and the Spotify playback after the initial start is done in their respective components.

Used by https://github.com/custom-cards/spotify-card.
